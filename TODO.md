# WriteWave Frontend - Modular Topics System TODO

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Already Implemented
- **Basic routing structure** with TanStack Router

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Decisions
- **Use OpenAPI client** instead of manual API calls for type safety
- **Implement generic patterns** to reduce code duplication
- **Maintain backward compatibility** during migration
- **Use feature flags** for gradual rollout of new features
- **Follow existing code style** and patterns where possible

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1** can be implemented alongside existing code
2. **Phase 2** requires careful coordination with routing changes
3. **Phase 3** involves gradual migration of existing entities
4. **Phase 4-5** are enhancements that can be added incrementally

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All entity types follow the same patterns
- [ ] New topics can be added with minimal code
- [ ] UI components are reusable across topics
- [ ] API integration is type-safe and consistent
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] Developer experience is significantly improved

## Quick Start Checklist

For immediate next steps, focus on:

1. **Set up OpenAPI client generation** (Phase 1.1)
2. **Create base entity interfaces** (Phase 1.2)
3. **Implement generic table component** (Phase 1.3)
4. **Refactor Tasks to use new patterns** (Phase 3.1)
5. **Test the new system with a simple topic** (Phase 2.1)

This will provide a solid foundation for the modular topics system while maintaining the existing functionality.
